Automatic Recovery with RabbitMQ:  
Enabled AutomaticRecoveryEnabled and set NetworkRecoveryInterval in ConnectionFactory to leverage RabbitMQâ€™s automatic recovery feature. This feature automatically attempts reconnection if a temporary connection loss occurs. Setting a recovery interval allows for a controlled delay between reconnection attempts, providing smoother recovery from transient issues.

Retry Logic with Polly:  
Integrated Polly to implement a retry policy with exponential backoff. This helps manage intermittent connection failures by retrying a set number of times with increasing wait periods. Using Polly enhances the reliability of message publishing by preventing immediate failure and allowing time for transient issues, like network interruptions, to resolve.

Connection Timeout Adjustment:  
Increased RequestedConnectionTimeout in ConnectionFactory to handle occasional connection timeouts caused by network latency or server load. Extending the timeout provides more time for RabbitMQ to establish a connection, reducing failures related to timeouts.

Enhanced Logging:  
Added detailed logging to track retry attempts and the outcomes of publishing operations. This logging provides insight into retry counts and failure reasons, helping to identify patterns and enabling effective monitoring and alerts for issues needing further investigation.

Common Application:  
Created a shared class library to centralize all shared code, acting as a link between the two applications instead of requiring direct references. This approach promotes better modularization and reduces coupling between the applications.

Dapper Over EntityFramework:  
Opted for Dapper due to its slightly faster performance compared to Entity Framework, making it a suitable choice for scenarios where speed and efficiency are prioritized.
